## General Info

This build is a general block explorer for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to search for and view transactions and blocks on the Ethereum network. With the Block Explorer, users can also see the current balance of a specific Ethereum address, view the history of an address, and check the status of a contract deployment. The Block Explorer also has a number of other features, such as a price feeds, gas price and market cap in real time.

## Technologies

Ethereum Block Explorer is built using a number of technologies, including:

I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework for production and will begin deploying to vercel once I finish.
Apart from the mentioned above technologies, I took huge advantage of the [ALchemy API](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/ethereum-api-quickstart)<br/>
The [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) was used for up to date ether, gas and market cap prices.<br/>
I would also like to include some [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) elements into the build at a later stage.

## Additional Features

In addition to basic block explorer functionality, Ethereum Block Explorer will also include the following features:

- Detailed wallet address section
- NFT feeds and floor prices
- Real-time updates
- NFT gallery for individual addresses

## Growth and Challenges

### Growth

+ Building an Ethereum block explorer allowed me to gain a full understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
+ Learned how the Ethereum state trie works as a mapping between addresses and account states
+ Gained a deeper understanding of operational codes and how they are used in the EVM
+ Learned about JSON-RPC and how it is used for sending and receiving JSON formatted messages in Ethereum
+ Gained a thorough understanding of Ethereum transactions, including the various components and how they fit together
